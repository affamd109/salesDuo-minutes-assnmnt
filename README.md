# Meeting Notes Processor API

This is a simple Express.js backend API that processes meeting notes using Googleâ€™s Gemini generative AI model.  
You can send meeting notes either as a `.txt` file upload or as raw text in the request body, and the API returns a JSON response with a summary, decisions, and action items.
